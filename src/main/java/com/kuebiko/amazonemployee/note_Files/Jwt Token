--Use of Jwt Token---
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a standardized way to securely send data between
two parties. They contain information (claims) encoded in the JSON format.
These claims help share specific details between the parties involved. At its
core, a JWT is a mechanism for verifying the authenticity of some JSON data.
